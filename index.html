            <h1>The basics of social networking</h1>
            <div> Social media is used widely across the world, with teenagers making up most of social media
                usage. Facebook and Myspace are two of the world’s most popular social networks; however, facebook was
                originally created for universities, and as time passed, it expanded to include high schools and others
                as
                well. Facebook’s association with universities helps it verify the authenticity of it’s users, but
                Myspace
                has no such standards, with a poor reputation for trust. Schools have attempted prohibiting Myspace,
                with
                law enforcement officers stating that Myspace has been used by sexual predators to exploit minors.
                Ironically, a majority of users of social networking sites will express strong feelings about privacy
                of
                personal information, but few are actually vigilant about it, as they believed it would be protected by
                said social networking sites.

                Engaging in social networking has been shown to benefit children and adolescents by enhancing their
                communication skills, making new relationships and connections, and even technical skills. However,
                there have been increases in behaviors more commonly found in reality, such as: bullying, sexual
                harassment; as well as new problems such as: cyberbullying, sexting, privacy issues. On the same token,
                social media allows people to stay connected, make new friends, share content, exchange ideas, and
                obtain deeper perspectives relating to their understanding of the world around them. Social media also
                allows people to access their health information, find people that share similar interests, raise funds
                for charity, and countless more benefits. The minimum age requirement for most social media sites is 13
                years old, but most people do understand why. This is due to an act passed by Congress; known as COPPA
                (Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act). Social media has also been known to cause depression. Many
                people do not understand that what goes online stays online, and as a result, jeopardize potential jobs
                with nothing more than a mouse click.</div>
