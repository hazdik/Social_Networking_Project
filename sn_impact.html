            <h1>The impact of social media</h1>
            <div>
                In the present day of social media and any place of social networking you are guaranteed to see at
                least
                one
                advertisement about some product you should buy. If you have Facebook, you will get an advertisement
                for
                something that you recently shopped for, looked at on Amazon, or even based on your web searches.
                Social
                media
                has helped a huge amount of small companies. An article from MIS Quarterly Executive stated, “500 to
                very
                small
                businesses, achieving and measuring business value from social media continues to pose challenges to
                many
                organizations.” The statistics show that in this day and age, companies are now more confident than
                ever;
                with
                more companies turning to social media platforms rather than commercials. MIS Quarterly Executive also
                stated,
                “64% used Web 2.0 platforms internally, 56% to communicate with customers, and 40% to work with
                external
                partners or suppliers.”

                Social media is used widely across the world, with teenagers making up most of social media usage.
                Facebook
                and
                Myspace are two of the world’s most popular social networks; however, Facebook was originally created
                for
                universities, and as time passed, it expanded to include high schools and others as well. Facebook’s
                association with universities helps it verify the authenticity of it’s users, but Myspace has no such
                standards, with a poor reputation for trust. Schools have attempted prohibiting Myspace, with law
                enforcement
                officers stating that Myspace has been used by sexual predators to exploit minors. Ironically, a
                majority
                of
                users of social networking sites will express strong feelings about privacy of personal information,
                but
                few
                are actually vigilant about it, as they believed it would be protected by said social networking sites.
