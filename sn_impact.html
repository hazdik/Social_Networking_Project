            In the present day of social media and any place of social networking you are guaranteed to see at least
            one
            advertisement about some product you should buy. If you have Facebook, you will get an advertisement for
            something that you recently shopped for, looked at on Amazon, or even based on your web searches. Social
            media
            has helped a huge amount of small companies. An article from MIS Quarterly Executive stated, “500 to very
            small
            businesses, achieving and measuring business value from social media continues to pose challenges to many
            organizations.” The statistics show that in this day and age, companies are now more confident than ever;
            with
            more companies turning to social media platforms rather than commercials. MIS Quarterly Executive also
            stated,
            “64% used Web 2.0 platforms internally, 56% to communicate with customers, and 40% to work with external
            partners or suppliers.”

            Social media is used widely across the world, with teenagers making up most of social media usage. Facebook
            and
            Myspace are two of the world’s most popular social networks; however, Facebook was originally created for
            universities, and as time passed, it expanded to include high schools and others as well. Facebook’s
            association with universities helps it verify the authenticity of it’s users, but Myspace has no such
            standards, with a poor reputation for trust. Schools have attempted prohibiting Myspace, with law
            enforcement
            officers stating that Myspace has been used by sexual predators to exploit minors. Ironically, a majority
            of
            users of social networking sites will express strong feelings about privacy of personal information, but
            few
            are actually vigilant about it, as they believed it would be protected by said social networking sites.
