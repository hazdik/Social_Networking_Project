            <h1>History of social networking</h1>
            <div>In 1997 the first type of social networking was called blogging which was a website for one person or
                groups if preferred and would eventually turned mainstream and have over 1 million people blogging and
                eventually AOL a online service provider like google or bing decided to make room chats which were able
                forf
                people to connect worldwide from the United States all the way to China</div>
            <br />
            <div>Then later on in 1999 a website called Friends United was created was technically you could say the
                first
                “facebook platform of all time” and this website allowed people to connect to old friends that they
                knew
                since kindergarten or back in high school and was then the new wave of the internet as 17 million
                people
                started using it and proved that this would be the new platform of media for centuries to come. Later
                on
                Friendster would be a thing in 2000 and the year later MySpace would be created and being the first to
                be
                unique being able to change profile pictures, adding a bio on your web page as well as being able to
                promote things such as bands, games, news outlets etc. </div>
            <br />
            <div>In the year 2003 multiple platforms on this such as podcast, Flickr, as well as LinkedIn for
                professional
                . Then the year after in 2004 Facebook would be created and would be known as the most used website of
                all
                time in the beginning it would have been for Harvard for students to connect then later having
                university
                and lastly having it available to the public and later going mainstream. Later on MySpace would past
                Friendster in page views and later bebo would have been created as well as youtube was created in 2005
                being the first unique website to have a place to where you are able to store and share videos easy.
                Then
                in 2006 Twitter would be created and would be a breaking barrier for fans being able to connect with
                their
                favorite celebrities as they would be able to communicate with them as well as see what they were
                doing.
                Eventually MySpace would become as big as Facebook and when apps became a thing many of these websites
                would seem to fall.</div>
            <br />
            <div>The first websites that would be doomed was Friendster and Friends reunited as they kept getting
                bought
                out by other companies and being rebranded and eventually couldn't be kept up which eventually would
                never
                be a thing along with Friendster, eventually companies started to notice how fast news could break out
                with
                FaceBook and Twitter and from 2009 till present day is now mainly a place where companies could put up
                ads
                for their products or as well put out news for anything.</div>
